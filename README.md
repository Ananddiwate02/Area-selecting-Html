# HTML Area Select Example
This repository demonstrates how to implement the area select functionality in HTML, allowing users to define selectable regions in an image or map.

Description
In HTML, the <map> element defines an image map, and the <area> element inside the <map> specifies clickable areas.

It can be used for creating interactive images like photo galleries, image editors, or maps.
